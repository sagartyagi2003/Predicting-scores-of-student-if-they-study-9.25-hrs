# Predicting-scores-of-student-if-they-study-9.25-hrs



The data set used is mentioned in the following link: "http://bit.ly/w-data"

In this regression task I tried to predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied.
This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables.
